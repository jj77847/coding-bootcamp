# Career Connection

## Career Connection

Congratulations! You've added yet another crucial asset to your web development toolbox. But coding skills alone won't get you a job&mdash;you also need to work toward becoming employer-ready.

If you still haven't completed the career services [Develop Your Resume milestone](https://mycareerspot.org/resume), be sure to send that resume to a Profile Coach as soon as possible. This important step will help you unlock employer-ready status and access a wide range of career-related materials.

### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

As you gain professional experience, you'll find that Sequelize is the ORM library of choice for many production applications. This dynamic tool&mdash;in active use by thousands of repositories and starred by thousands of GitHub users&mdash;can help you do all of the following:

- Save time and effort (which translates to money in the business world).

- Harness the power of Node.js or other languages.

- Keep application code robust.

- Manage queries.

- Maintain multiple databases.

With all of these capabilities, it is no wonder that Sequelize is wildly popular! 

### Looking to the Future

Preparing to interview means not just reviewing the material you’ve learned during boot camp but also knowing how this material relates to other technologies, beyond what you'll learn here.

As you know, Sequelize is the popular go-to ORM for Node.js. However, other ORMs might work better with other programming languages. Research the ORM of choice for each of the following three languages, and list the advantages and disadvantages of each one:

* Java

* C#

* Python

You don't have to know how to use every one of these technologies, but you should at least know a bit about what they are. By no means is this an exhaustive list, so feel free to keep researching! The more you know, the better equipped you'll be.

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find the following algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Double Triple Map

- Coding Algorithm #2: Array Intersection

- Coding Algorithm #3: Squares of a Sorted Array

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge: 

* CodeSignal Algorithm: [FizzBuzz Plus Plus](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/7hMoNBiFhuHrPf8Lp/fy3rAkYRnKwKRe)

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

### Career Services Events

If you want to learn more about the technical interviewing process and practice algorithms in a mock-interview setting, attend one of our [upcoming workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp)!
