## Career Connection

By the end of Project #2, you’ll have built your first collaborative full-stack web application. What an accomplishment! Armed with two group projects to show off, you should take a few steps to prepare for the last part of this course: your journey to landing your first job as a full-stack developer! First of all, consider how you might talk about this project when applying for jobs. Then update your portfolio page and other professional materials to become more employer-competitive.

### Technical Interview Preparation

Interviewers often ask about your contributions to technical projects you’ve participated in. This question can feel harrowing or flat-out unfair if you haven’t held a technical job before. You may worry that you don't have any relevant projects or experience.

Fortunately, now you do have relevant technical projects: namely, the group projects you’ve completed for this course.

#### Trust Your Technical Expertise

First things first. Dispel any notion that your classwork doesn’t count as technical expertise just because it’s classwork. Previous technical projects don’t have to come from contract work or be otherwise assigned by an employer. Your group projects in the boot camp demand hard work, creative problem-solving, and real technical skills. The fact that you completed them should be enough to impress any potential employer.

#### Treat Your Projects as Products

A portfolio of impressive projects can help you attract employers, but that alone won’t get you the job. While you continue coding new projects, you should also learn how to discuss the technical problems you’ve already encountered and solved. Instead of describing your projects as assignments, describe them as products&mdash;and summarize them with an abbreviated elevator pitch. You should explain the initial problem and the steps you took to solve it. 

An elevator pitch should include the following details:

* Description: one or two sentences summarizing your project.

* Motivation: two or three sentences describing the problem the project solves and answering the question, “Why would I want to use this product?”

* Results: one or two sentences describing the end results.

In addition to a compelling description of the product as a whole, you’ll need a compelling description of your team’s responsibilities, covering the following details:

* Team efforts. You should discuss how you delegated work amongst your team members so that you look like a team player and so that your interviewer knows which areas they can reasonably hold you accountable for.

* Individual responsibilities&mdash;the parts of the project that you were accountable for. Discuss features you implemented or serious problems you fixed. Prepare to discuss these in-depth, if prompted.

* Substantial challenges that you or your team encountered and that you personally helped resolve. Your contribution should be clearly relevant.

* Updates that you’d make going forward, including changes you’d make for better scalability, features you’d add, or improvements you’d make to the codebase.

You should be able to deliver your elevator pitch in less than 45 seconds and summarize your team efforts, individual responsibilities, challenges, and improvements in approximately a minute. You should, however, be able to further elaborate on individual responsibilities, improvements, and challenges if prompted.


### Updated Portfolio

One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio. You should also add two more Challenge assignments that you’re proud of, so that your portfolio includes your two deployed projects and two to four deployed Challenges. You may have opted to use the solution code that you received for your Module 2 Challenge as a template for your portfolio. Alternatively, you could create your own as you complete this course.

Make sure that your portfolio includes the following:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn page, as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* A list of projects, including the following details for each one:

	* Project title

	* Link to the deployed version

	* Link to the GitHub repository

	* Screenshot of the deployed application

Your site should look polished. Refer to the following guidelines in particular:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Choose a color palette for your site so that it doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Ensure that the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Professional Materials

You should update your professional materials again, including the following:


#### Update Your GitHub Profile

If you haven't yet, update the following in your GitHub profile:

* Profile picture

* Bio

* Location

* Email

* Link to your portfolio

Employers and potential collaborators will look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward!

You’ll also want to pin some repos that you want to highlight. To do this, navigate to GitHub, go to your profile, and do the following:

1. Click "Customize your pins".

2. Click the checkboxes for your projects and two to four Challenge assignments that you want to share.

3. Check that each of these projects is deployed, and add a link to the deployed project in the README file.

4. Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network, and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is about writing code.

#### Update Your Resume

Update your resume with the skills you’ve learned since the first group project. Make sure that you have a clear, concise, and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you’re looking for.

#### Update Your LinkedIn Profile

Update your LinkedIn profile with your new skills and technologies and make sure that you include a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github profile and portfolio.
