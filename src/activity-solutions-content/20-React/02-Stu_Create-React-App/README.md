# üìê Add Comments That Describe the Functionality of a React App

## Before We Begin

Initializing a React application by using the `create-react-app` command-line utility can take some time. To save time throughout this unit, we will create one React application and only replace the `/src` files for each subsequent activity as we work on them. Before you add comments to the code, you will practice the workflow for creating a React app and updating your practice app for subsequent activities.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the command line, navigate to `20-React/01-Activities`.

2. Run the command `npx create-react-app 00-practice-app`.

3. After `create-react-app` has completed (which can take a few minutes), run the command `npm i bootstrap dotenv axios --save` to add dependencies that we will need in later activities.

4. Copy the `src/` folder from `02-Stu_Create-React-App` and paste it into the root of `00-practice-app`.

5. Run `npm start` to ensure that the source files were transplanted successfully.

## Activity

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code in [00-practice-app/src](../00-practice-app/src).

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some other flags that you can use with the `create-react-app` utility?
