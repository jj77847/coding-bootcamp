- Focus on ensuring that you use sematic HTML elements where possible
- check the nav links, if not working fix them. The nav links must take the user to the specific section on the page
- check where you can refactor css blocks in the CSS files, reduce duplication of style declarations
- please add comments in the HTML and CSS files (high level comments, for instance this is the benefits section of the marketing website)
- see where you can improve accessibility in the HTML file (images, links)
- logical structure?? Maybe sequential order for headings?? Logical order for semantic HTML elements
- please keep alt attributes descriptive of the image
- document title should be descriptive
- don't focus on mobile viewport for this homework and only stick to desktop viewport
