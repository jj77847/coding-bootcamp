## Notes

- I should be able to search for a city
  - When you click on submit:
    - validate that the input is not empty
    - fetch weather data (current and forecast) for given city
    - render the current weather data card
    - render the forecast cards
    - add city to local storage
    - re-render the search history to reflect the new city search

```javascript
{
  current: {
    name: "London",
    temperature: 123.45,
    wind: 111.22,
    humidity: 33,
    uvi: 2.5,
    date: "(3/30/2021)"
    iconCode: "04n"
  },
  forecast: [
    {
      date: "(3/30/2021)",
      temperature: 123.45,
      wind: 111.22,
      humidity: 33,
      iconCode: "04n"
    },
    {
      date: "(3/30/2021)",
      temperature: 123.45,
      wind: 111.22,
      humidity: 33,
      iconCode: "04n"
    },
    {
      date: "(3/30/2021)",
      temperature: 123.45,
      wind: 111.22,
      humidity: 33,
      iconCode: "04n"
    },
    {
      date: "(3/30/2021)",
      temperature: 123.45,
      wind: 111.22,
      humidity: 33,
      iconCode: "04n"
    },
    {
      date: "(3/30/2021)",
      temperature: 123.45,
      wind: 111.22,
      humidity: 33,
      iconCode: "04n"
    }
  ]
}
