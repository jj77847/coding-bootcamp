- demo the CLI app
- show the generated HTML
- open generated HTML file in browser
- run tests in terminal and show all tests passing, maybe you can show coverage report as well

Notes:

- prompt some questions
- collect all data and use data to write to HTML file (fs)
- make sure that the HTML template has mailto attribute in the anchor tag
- make sure that the HTML template renders the github link as an anchor tag to open in new tab (target="_blank")
- when application is complete use process.exit(0)
- can use bootstrap or any other CSS framework or your own CSS, free to use google fonts, colour palettes, etc
- the path when writing to file should point to the dist folder
- Important: Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
