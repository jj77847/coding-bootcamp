## Career Connection

Previously, you focused on sending a JSON file that you could use to create webpages back to the client. Now you've learned a new way to do this, through templating and the MVC folder structure model!

Handlebars.js doesn't win over every developer. In this unit, we cover a lot of ground, and we do it pretty fast. However, we can't stress how important it is, especially if you end up working in a language like Python, C#, or Java. After all, most programming languages used for server-side web application development are compatible with a templating engine or use their own proprietary templating engine&mdash;and almost all work like Handlebars.js.

Let's look at those.

> **Note:** You don't need to know the ins and outs of each of these, but it helps to know that they exist so that you can address them in interviews or recognize the terms in job descriptions!

### Templating in Other Programming Languages

Time to explore some of the more common templating languages! For each of the following programming languages, we’ve listed the name of its templating engine, so that you can explore them and find out how they work!

* Java: [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)

* C#: [Razor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)

* Python: [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/)

* PHP: [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/blade)

You should note that each programming language can work with more than one templating language. The templating languages mentioned here are just some of the more popular ones you might encounter.

All of these templating languages are descendants of the great Mustache templating library&mdash;hence why we see the familiar `{{yourData}}` syntax throughout them.

### Look to the Future

Take some time now to envision your future as a full-stack web developer. To prepare for the job search in a few short months, visit [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/jobs) and search for job postings that mention MVC!

Note all the different programming languages you see that work with the MVC paradigm and that employers are currently looking to hire for.

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Common Element

- Coding Algorithm #2: Permutation Substring

- Coding Algorithm #3: String Map

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.

- CodeSignal Algorithm: [Check Palindrome](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/zE2ktiq86xwEnMov2/bY2xgpYL4NGKoE)

### Career Services Events

If you want to hear more about the technical interviewing process and practicing algorithms in a mock-interview setting, attend one of our [upcoming workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp)!
