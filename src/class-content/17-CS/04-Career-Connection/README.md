# Career Connection

## Career Connection

Computer science fundamentals, eh? That's tough stuff, and you have to try and get your head around it pretty quickly. If you're walking away from the material a little confused about it's relevance or why you should care&mdash;that's okay! 

Here's the deal: we've taught you how to build web applications from scratch since day one. And you can now do that using MongoDB or MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, and React. You can build essentially anything you want with a little creativity and hard work. And that's largely what you'll be doing day-to-day as a web developer when you land that job you've been working very hard for!

But you _do_ have to get through the interview first. And unfortunately, many companies still follow the old adage that you need to know computer science and be able to solve algorithms in order to get through that interview&mdash;even if you won't be applying the bulk of those concepts moving forward. So that's what this week was about, and it's also why you've had weekly algorithm practice since we introduced JavaScript.

If you haven't been working on those algorithms each week, you still can! All the links and solutions are still there and are still valid for you to use. And if you're looking for some additional practice beyond this week, here are some places you can head to:

* [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/)
* [HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
* [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

### Looking to the Future

So by now you should have completed all of the following professional materials:

- Portfolio
- GitHub profile with pinned repositories
- Resume

If you have not yet submitted them to a Career Materials Advisor, now is the time to do so! Remember, if you get marked off as having completed all employer-ready tasks, you are eligible to be referred to employer partners that come looking for recruits!

As we mentioned already, this is the last Career Connection that you'll see. From here on out, you'll work with your Career Coach one-on-one for job interview preparation, job search help, and whatever else you need that is career related. Career Coachs can be booked out a couple of weeks in advance, so it's important that you get on their schedule now!

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After the seven days have elapsed, the challenge will close.
