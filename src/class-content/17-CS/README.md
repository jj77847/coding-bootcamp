# Unit 17: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview:

In this unit, we will look at how computer science relates to JavaScript in order to prepare you for the technical interview portion of the job interview, which every developer eventually faces. Some of these topics may feel abstract and confusing at times, but remember&mdash;you've been using JavaScript for several months. Now we are simply taking a closer look at how JavaScript executes so we can better understand how our code interacts with its environment.

In the first two lessons, we will dissect JavaScript in order to learn how our code executes at a granular level. We will also explore the fascinating behavior of closures and how we can leverage them in our code. Finally, we will compare inheritance and composition in application design.

In the final lesson, we will review search algorithms and how recursion works in JavaScript. For the mini-project, you will practice a mock interview with your peers. This will give you an opportunity to learn about the technical interview portion of the web-developer job interview process. You'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Global Execution Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#global_context)

* [Functional Execution Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#Function_context)

* [Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

* [Event Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop)

* [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

* [Composition Over Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)

* [Practical Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures/#Practical_closures)

* [Linear Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search)

* [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)

* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Bubble_sort)

* [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Quicksort)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Explain the differences between a global execution context and a function execution context.

* Identify when a function execution context is created and what is stored in it.

* Describe the functions of the call stack and the callback queue.

* Compare and contrast a stack vs. a queue in terms of LIFO and FIFO.

* Summarize asynchronous behavior and the role of the event loop.

* Construct a higher-order function.

* Explain the lexical environment.

* Identify encapsulated variables.

* Create a factory function.

* Distinguish between inheritance and composition design.

* Implement a linear search algorithm.

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you can solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessment.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video for tips and tricks on how to solve the corresponding algorithm.

* [01: Reverse Words](./03-Algorithms/01-reverse-no-built-in)

* [02: Left Rotation](./03-Algorithms/02-left-rotation)

    * ðŸ“¹ [Let's Code Left Rotation!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/kfyhj4z6fn)

* [03: Reverse in Place](./03-Algorithms/03-reverse-in-place)

### Assessment

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges in the following assessment:

## Homework

In this unit's homework, youâ€™ll create a technical tutorial that explains how a particular regular expression functions. A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, youâ€™ll break down each part of the expression and describe what it does.

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, we will return to the back end and learn about NoSQL databases using MongoDB, a popular, document-based database that integrates easily with JavaScript.

Be sure to have MongoDB and Compass installed on your machine before class. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB and Compass locally.

Mongo Atlas, a fully managed cloud database, will be used to deploy the Mini-Project to Heroku. For instructions on how to sign-up for a account and deploy a free cluster, refer to [MongoDB Atlas setup guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-set-up-mongodb-atlas).

This is an early heads-up that the Unit 22 Homework will be an optional assignment. It is not required for submission and your final grade will not be affected in any way. The Unit 22 Homework is an opportunity for you to further practice your skills and get feedback on it.
