# Unit 18: NoSQL

## Overview

In this unit, you will learn about NoSQL databases and perform CRUD operations using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL, document-based database. You will also learn to use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library with your underlying MongoDB database to enforce a specific schema and handle data relationships. Deployment of an application using Mongo Atlas and Heroku is also covered.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Visually Exploring Data with MongoDB Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/)

* [MongoDB Databases and Collections](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/)

* [MongoDB CRUD Operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)

* [MongoDB Embedded Documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/data-model-design/#std-label-data-modeling-embedding)

* [MongoDB Cursor Methods](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/)

* [Mongoose Models and Schemas](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

* [Mongoose CRUD Operations](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html)

* [Mongoose Instance Methods](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods)

* [Mongoose Subdocuments](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html)

* [Mongoose Aggregate](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/aggregate.html#aggregate_Aggregate)

* [Mongoose Virtuals](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/virtuals.html)

* [Mongoose Populate](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html)

* [Mongoose Subdocuments CRUD Operations](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html#finding-a-subdocument)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Create and manipulate data using MongoDB Compass

* Insert, find, and return documents stored within a MongoDB database

* Update and delete documents stored in MongoDB database

* Explain how embedded documents can be used to create one-to-one and one-to-many relationships

* Limit, sort, and skip documents using MongoDB methods

* Define the structure of the database with a Mongoose schema

* Create a model to map to the MongoDB document and provide functionality

* Execute CRUD queries using Mongoose

* Explain the difference between an instance method and a static method

* Create and manipulate a subdocument

* Access MongoDB's aggregate framework through Mongoose's `aggegrate()` method

* Implement a Mongoose virtual property to create computed properties

* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB Atlas

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [02: Min Increment for Unique](./03-Algorithms/02-min-increment-for-unique)

* [03: Peak Finder](./03-Algorithms/03-peak-finder)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

Your homework is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Youâ€™ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In Unit 19, you will learn about measuring and optimizing the performance of web applications, as well as learning how to create Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). Chrome Devtools and Google Lighthouse will be our primary tools for measuring web application performance. We will use the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses, which ensures that the application will continue to work without an internet connection. To unlock the power of service workers, we will use `webpack` and Workbox.

This unit is a precursor to the upcoming React units, because webpack is an important part of React. Also, while learning about PWAs, you will gain exposure to the client-server architecture, which is different from the MVC model that we've been using in previous modules.
