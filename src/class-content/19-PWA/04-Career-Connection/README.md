# Career Connection

## Career Connection

This week, you're learning how to create Progressive Web Applications (PWA) and optimize legacy applications to ensure that they are accessible to devices running on slower connections. While this might not sound like an exciting topic, it is an incredibly important skillset to have as you start talking with prospective employers!

In an ideal world, we'd all love to go out and write code using the latest technologies, including React, Express, and others you might not even have heard about yet, such as GraphQL. However, the reality is a little different. Many companies, even when writing new applications using the latest technologies, still need to maintain older applications that were built using a mixture of plain JavaScript and jQuery, and server-side languages like PHP instead of Node.js.

So when you go out on that job interview, remember to tell the interviewer what you can do for their legacy applications while also developing their cutting-edge applications!

### Employer-Competitive Advantage

Are you already looking at companies that you'd like to interview with? If not, then start with Step 1. If you already have a list of companies that you're interested in working for in the future, jump ahead to Step 2.

#### Step 1: Search LinkedIn Jobs

Follow these steps to search Linkedin Jobs:

1. Go to [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) and try entering some search terms in the "Search jobs" field. Some options include javascript developer, react developer, front-end developer, back-end developer, full-stack developer, or software developer. In the location, add your current location or the place you would like to work and select "Search".

2. Write down the names of 3-4 companies that have open positions that you've either heard of or seem like places (from the job description) you'd like to work at

#### Step 2: Evaluate Prospective Employers' Websites

Follow these steps to evaluate the performance of prospective employers' websites:

1. Visit the website of one of the companies you're interested in working for.

2. On their home page, run a Lighthouse audit with "Applied Slow 4G" enabled.

3. Note the areas of their website that need improvement and how, using the skills you learned this week, you could improve the audit scores.

### Looking to the Future: Developing your PWA Knowledge

Converting a website or an application to a PWA is a skill that takes practice. To get that practice, follow these three key steps:

1. Analyze the website or application to identify problem areas.
   * Are the images, CSS, and JavasScript files too large?
   * Could the CSS and JavaScript files be combined?
   * Could images be lazy-loaded?
   * Could the website or application be converted to a PWA?

2. Develop solutions to reduce these problems.
   * Compress the images
   * Use webpack to minimize CSS an JavaScript
   * Use webpack to implement tree-shaking
   * Lazy-load images so they load when they scroll into view
   * Assess whether the website or application could work as a PWA. Does the content update infrequently? Could it function offline? Would it make fewer network requests?

3. Implement the solutions you have developed.
   * As a beginner, it can be hard to know what exactly the best steps are, but doing it multiple times will help you on your way.

#### Your Task

To put these steps into practice, complete the following task:

1. Once you've completed this week's homework and project, complete a performance audit on 2 or 3 web apps that you have built during the coding bootcamp.

2. Take notes on where you can optimize those applications.

3. Implement fixes for them.

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository for these algorithms:

* Coding Algorithm #1: Is Armstrong

* Coding Algorithm #2: Max Profit

* Coding Algorithm #3: Smallest Difference

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following CodeSignal algorithm challenge. Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it.

* CodeSignal Algorithm: [Missing Number](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/xttcwYyLzN9udSHRm/oEiyqtuFgGaFLj)

### Career Services Events
