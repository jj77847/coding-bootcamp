# Unit 20: React

## Overview

In this unit, you will learn how to create a single-page application (SPA) using React. React is a powerful and elegant technology, as well as a very in-demand skill to have as a web developer. As you create your SPA, you will learn how to use React components, manage application state, and pass data throughout your app. You'll get a sense for how React works under the hood and the problems it solves in modern web development. By the end of this unit, you will be one step closer to being employer-ready.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Identify the differences between a class-based and functional-based component.

* Identify the pros and cons of using React single-page applications (SPAs).

* Use React props.

* Manage state using React.

* Use React Hooks.

* Use Jest to test React components.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [01: Maximum Continuous Sub-Array](./../../../01-Class-Content/20-React/03-Algorithms/01-maximum-continuous-subarray/README.md)
  
* [02: Merge Meeting Times](./../../../01-Class-Content/20-React/03-Algorithms/02-merge-meeting-times/README.md)

  * ðŸ“¹ [Let's Code Merge Meeting Times!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/rsyvzd1cxl)

* [03: Int to Roman Numeral](./../../../01-Class-Content/20-React/03-Algorithms/03-int-to-roman/README.md)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

In the homework, youâ€™ll create a portfolio page using React. This project will help set you apart from other developers who are using basic HTML or less cutting-edge technologies.

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

This unit will use the `create-react-app` command-line utility. To ensure we are using the latest version available, we will use the Node Package Runner (`npx`). `npx` automatically finds the correct package without it needing to be installed globally.

`npx` comes with `npm`, so it should be installed already, but just to be sure you can run the following command to ensure you have it installed:

```sh
npx --version
```
