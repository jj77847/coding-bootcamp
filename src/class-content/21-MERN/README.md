# Unit 21: MERN

## Overview

This week, you will use your skills in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to develop the tools needed to build a full-stack MERN app.

Youâ€™ll use React Router to make the application behave more like a multi-page application, allowing users to bookmark URLs and use the browserâ€™s forward and back buttons. Youâ€™ll also add GraphQL, an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs that lets you fetch only the data you want from the database when you need it. Finally, youâ€™ll learn how to use a JSON Web Token, or JWT, to add authentication to your site.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/)

* [GraphQL Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

* [Resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/resolvers/)

* [Query parameters](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/)

* [Mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/)

* [useMutation Hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/mutations/)

* [useQuery Hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/queries/)

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

* [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)

* [Authentication in GraphQL API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/authentication/)

* [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Define a GraphQL schema and implement resolvers to handle data population.

* Write a GraphQL query to read data with and without parameters.

* Use a GraphQL mutation to create and update data.

* Execute queries and mutations using `useQuery()` and `useMutation()` Hooks.

* Update GraphQL's in-memory cache.

* Implement client-side routing by using React Router.

* Securely transmit data as a JSON object using JWT.

* Implement server-side authentication in GraphQL API.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [01: Plus One](./03-Algorithms/01-plus-one)

* [02: One Edit Away](./03-Algorithms/02-one-edit-away)

* [03: Caesar Cipher](./03-Algorithms/03-caesar-cipher)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

As a developer, you will often be tasked with working with an existing codebase and updating the app to use a new technology. For this week's homework, you will take an existing book search engine that was built using a RESTful API and refactor it to use a GraphQL API.

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

During the next unit, we build on our full-stack app development skills as we learn about state management and the Context API. We will also review the key concepts covered in this unit to help you prepare for your final project.

Remember the Unit 22 Homework will be an optional assignment. It is not required for submission and your final grade will not be affected in any way. Next week's Homework is an opportunity for you to further practice your skills and get feedback on it.

## Resources

Here are some additional resources to help solidify the topics covered in this unit.

### Git Guide
