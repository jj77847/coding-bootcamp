Go ahead and start the tech interview prep!

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Roman to Int

- Coding Algorithm #2: Rotation Point

- Coding Algorithm #3: Simplify Path

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.

- CodeSignal Algorithm: [Change to Ones](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/jYHQ873GTw8sCwmDv/3LodRHTbsfXA6s)

If you're interested in hearing more about the technical interviewing process and practicing algorithms in a mock interview setting, attend one of our [upcoming workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp)!
