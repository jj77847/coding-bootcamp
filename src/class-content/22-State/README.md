# Unit 22: State

## Overview

In this unit, we will work with complex state management techniques and review the key tools needed to build a MERN-stack app with routing and authentication.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Context.Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider)

* [Context.Consumer](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextconsumer)

* [Redux reducers](https://redux.js.org/faq/reducers/)

* [Redux actions](https://redux.js.org/faq/actions/)

* [useReducer React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

* [useState React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

* [JWT authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction)

* [GraphQL type definitions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/#object-types)

* [Stripe payment platform](https://stripe.com/docs)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Pass and store data down a React component tree using the Context API `Provider`.

* Consume data passed between components using the Context API `Consumer`.

* Implement Redux to manage state in a React application.

* Implement local and global state with the `useReducer` Hook.

* Describe the functionality of the `StoreProvider` component.

* Identify use cases for complex state management tools including the Context API and Redux.

* Implement the Stripe payment platform in a MERN application.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [01: Roman Numeral to Int](./03-Algorithms/01-roman-to-int)

* [02: Rotation Point](./03-Algorithms/02-rotation-point)

  * ðŸ“¹ [Let's Code Rotation Point!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/92nkaslwg8)

* [03: Simplify Path](./03-Algorithms/03-simplify-path)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

This unit's Homework is **optional**. It is not required for submission and your final grade will not be affected in any way. The Unit 22 Homework is an opportunity for you to further practice your skills and get feedback on it.

Your homework this week is to refactor the e-commerce platform from [Activity 26](./01-Activities/26-Stu_Actions-Reducers/Unsolved) so that it uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). You wonâ€™t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but you will need to read through the Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. If you haven't yet, download the [Activity 26 code](http://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/fullstack-ground/unit-22/26-Stu_Actions-Reducers.zip).

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In Unit 23, you will apply your skills to designing and developing a full-stack app to showcase to employers. For this final project, you will choose your own team and collaborate to plan and develop an app from idea to finished project, with the support of your instructional team.
