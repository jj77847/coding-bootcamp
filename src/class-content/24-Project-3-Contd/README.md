# Unit 24: Final Project Continued

## Overview

Welcome to the second week of Project 3! Youâ€™ve been working hard on your group project during the past week, collaborating with your fellow developers and creating a real-world MERN stack single-page application that you can showcase to potential employers. This week you will continue to work on your group project to create an interactive full-stack MERN application.

At the end of this week, your group will present the application to your classmates. Because this is a large-scale web application, you should consider concentrating on specific aspects of the project in your presentation, following the principle of the separation of concerns. Though each individual should be able to speak about their own contributions, this is still a group project. Be sure to emphasize how the different parts of your application came together and how you worked as a group!

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Full-stack applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack MERN application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Homework

For this week's homework, you'll finish your final project and give a presentation on it in class. Then you'll update your portfolio page and other professional materials to build towards being employer-competitive.

Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but it's also critical on your journey as a developer.

## Heads-Up

You started this course with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. Youâ€™ve now gone well beyond that goal, picking up critical soft skills and adding cutting-edge technologies that will help you stand apart from the field of junior developers. Youâ€™ll finish this class with a certification in web development, but thatâ€™s not what really makes you a developer.

As weâ€™ve mentioned again and again, developers have a ceaseless desire to learn, and youâ€™ve proven that you possess this trait. Youâ€™ve learned a lot in six months! This course allowed you to develop the skills and habits you need to get started coding, but your dedication to learning and to solving real-world problems will ensure that you always think like a developer.

Take a moment to marvel at everything youâ€™ve learned how to do, and how this relates to real-world scenarios you encounter every day. Think of how many times youâ€™ve pulled up a site on your phone and had to deal with a poor internet connection. Think of how youâ€™ve still been able to interact with this site in spite of this. Now remind yourself that youâ€™ve created applications with that exact functionality!

Think about all the social networks you use on a daily basis. Imagine how many users across the world use these same sites and how these user demands create the need for performant and efficient technologies -- the same technologies that youâ€™re using to create lightning-fast applications that do all the same things your favorite social networks can do.

Run through the events of your day and try to think of how many times you used a payment platform on a website. Many of those sites likely use the same payment platform you learned to work with in this course, and you now have the skills to add that to your apps!

Finally, think of where you were six months ago and where you are today. You **are** a developer. And you always will be.
