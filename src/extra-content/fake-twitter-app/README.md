## Fake Twitter Data

Write a function which receives a list of tweets related to cars from the fake twitter API and performs the following operations:

- filter out the tweets that contain hashtags "honda", "audi" and "bmw"
- sort the tweets by ID in descending order
- transform the resultant object to the one shown below and ensure the following operations
  - should insert the total likes of all tweets
  - construct a new string for hashtags as `#cars #nissan #newcar`
  - construct a new string for title as `Tweet from <username here>`

```javascript
{
  tweets: [
    {
      id: 300,
      likes: 6378,
      message: "Kia was over-rated!!",
      title: "Tweet from Alice",
      hashtags: "#cars #kia #newcar",
    },
    {
      id: 121,
      likes: 52342,
      message: "I love my new nissan!!",
      title: "Tweet from Bob",
      hashtags: "#cars #nissan #newcar",
    },
  ],
  likes: 58720
}
```

The returned object is then used by the UI-client to render a list of tweets and relevant data.

### JSON data sample

      username: 'Kate',
      hashtags: ['cars', 'bmw', 'newcar'],
    },
    {
      id: 121,
      likes: 52342,
      message: 'I love my new nissan!!',
      username: 'Bob',
      hashtags: ['cars', 'nissan', 'newcar'],
    },
    {
      id: 300,
      likes: 6378,
      message: 'Kia was over-rated!!',
      username: 'Alice',
      hashtags: ['cars', 'kia', 'newcar'],
    },
  ];
}
```
