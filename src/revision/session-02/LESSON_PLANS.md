Build a jQuery web application which allows a user to manage a list of TODO items.

> AS a user I should be able to view all my items to do

> AS a user I should be able to add a new to do item by completing a form with a title input and description input

> AS a user I should be able to edit the status of my to do item from incomplete to complete

> AS a user I should be able to edit the title and description of my to do item

> AS a user I should be able to delete my to do item

**TODO ITEM**

The to do item card should contain the following data points:

```
- Title
- Description
- Status - Incomplete (default) or Complete
- Created at - Moment formatted (Sunday, 30th Jan, 2022)
- Updated at - Moment formatted (Sunday, 30th Jan, 2022)
